# Final Project Code and Data

* Due Tuesday 2016/5/24 (last day of exam period) at 9am.
* You must fork this repository as described in the [HW Submission 
Exercise](https://github.com/Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-0#hw-submission-exercise).
* Ensure all data files are in the folder `files`. So for example, if you have a
file `data.csv` in the `files` folder you want to load, you need to use
`read.csv("files/data.csv")` and not `read.csv("data.csv")`.
* Fill in the project details below.
* Delete this section.
* Push/commit **all files necessary** for me to reproduce your final report.

Any good repository on GitHub will have an informative cover page. It is an
advertisement of your work and should give basic instructions on how to use
it/replicate your work. The contents of the file `README.md` end up being what's
on the repository cover page. For example:

* The [repo page for `dplyr`](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr).
* The contents of its [`README.md` file](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/blob/master/README.md) (click on RAW).

The way you will create your `README.md` is via `README.Rmd`:

* **DO NOT EDIT** `README.md`
* Rather, edit `README.Rmd`, which will run any R code, and then output the file
`README.md`.
* When you push/commit `README.md`, it will show up as your repo's cover page.
